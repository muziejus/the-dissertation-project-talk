## About You (in a Minute)

---

(alt title:)

## Not Dissertating by Optimizing the Means of Optimal Dissertating

Note: This is kind of an alternate title for this talk, because one of the
best parts about being a scholar who is super focused on a certain topic is
that one can often not focus on that topic by thinking about how to focus on
that topic better. I need a new system to get my work done faster! More
efficiently!

---

## [Parkinson’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law):<br />Work expands to fill up available time

Note: At the same time, we have Parkinson’s law. 

---

## Or:<br />If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute

Note: These sorts of organizational adages out of the way, I have only one
more, and that’s what’s going to be the focus of this presentation and a
description of why I think it’s worth spending a little time, especially at
the beginning, to optimize the means of optimal dissertating.

---

## Your Scholarly Work Is Not a _Document_.<br />It Is a _Project_.

Note: This is, of course, on the one hand obvious. At least when I was in
graduate school, we’d always talk about our projects when introducing
ourselves. We wouldn’t say “my interest is in how realist US novels of the
1930s model alternate political worlds to inspire readers to agitate for
change.” Instead, we’d say “my project looks at how...”

And yet, when it comes time to build this project, we increasingly imagine it
as just a giant, shaggy, Word or, these days, Google Docs document. Or, worse,
maybe several iterations of the same document with names like diss1 diss2
diss10 diss10final diss10finaledits diss10finaleditsfinal
diss10finaleditsfinalreallyfinal

So what we’re going to do today is think about ways to decouple the document
from the project so that both play the appropriate conceptual roles as you
advance forward.

## Now about You

1. What’s your name?
2. What’s your project?
4. How have you optimized the means of optimal dissertating?
5. (and/or: What are your tools, though?)

---

## What to do?

---

## Read a Book

Journey" style="max-height: 50vh;" />

Note: Well, you can read a book. Book is fine. Uses the metaphor of a journey
up a mountain.

## Dissertation to Gitsertation?

## Git Lets You…

* Track Changes
* Backup 
* Journal 
* Handle To-Dos (with GitHub)

---

<blockquote style="width: 70vw">Every [Git] repository is a complete, self-contained, cryptographically
signed copy of [your dissertation], with a log of every recorded step in its
development… It puts you in the habit of committing
changes to a file or project piecemeal as you work on it, and (briefly)
documenting those changes as you go. It allows you to easily test out
alternative lines of development or thinking by creating “branches” of a
project… Perhaps most importantly, it lets you revisit any stage of a
project’s development at will and reconstruct what it was you were doing.</blockquote>

dissertation or academic journal suggests the work is scholarly or
scientific.
